# POTD Solutions - Application Club MNNIT

This repository contains the solutions to the Problem of the Day (POTD) challenges provided by the Application Club at MNNIT. These problems are part of our Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) journey, and this repo serves as a collection of my solutions to help track my progress and improve my problem-solving skills.

## Purpose
The primary objective of this repository is to document and share the solutions to each daily problem, allowing me to monitor my growth and understanding of DSA concepts. Each problem includes my approach, code, and occasional notes for further learning.

## Structure
- Each problem is organized in its own directory with:
  - The problem description.
  - The solution code.
  - Any relevant explanations or notes.

## Usage
Feel free to browse the repository for problem-solving insights and code examples. You can clone this repo to follow along or use it as a reference for DSA learning.

## Contributions
If you'd like to contribute or suggest improvements to my solutions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions are always welcome!
